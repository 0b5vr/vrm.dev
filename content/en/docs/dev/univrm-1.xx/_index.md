* [UniVRM-1.0 draft](https://github.com/vrm-c/UniVRM_1_0) repository will serve as the core library for VRM1.0's Editor&Runtime. Other utilities such as UniHumanoid and VRMViewer will be managed in [UniVRMUtility](https://github.com/vrm-c/UniVRMUtility).
* Help us find any feature from UniVRM-0.X missed in UniVRM-1.X! Open an issue and state what features are missed in UniVRM-1.X ([Example](https://github.com/vrm-c/UniVRM_1_0/issues/55)). Thank you!
