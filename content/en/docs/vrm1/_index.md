## About VRM-1.0
In the 3D avatar file format "VRM" announced in 2018, it is a standard that fixes problems and errors that are found as the use progresses, and adds functions that are considered to be necessary in the future.

Traditional VRMs will be classified as VRM 0.x and deprecated in the future, and VRM 1.0 will become a formal standard in the future.

## About VRM-1.0Beta
VRM 1.0 is being developed by dividing it into multiple parts.
Each part takes one of the three development stages.

1. It's still a "draft phase" that can change significantly.
2. Although it has not been confirmed, it is a "Beta stage" that can be used sufficiently.
3. It is a "official version" that has been confirmed as a standard.

As of November 2021, parts (VRM_node_constraint) that are in the draft phase are also left.
However, because it is available throughout, the exception of the Constraint feature is called VRM 1.0Beta.
